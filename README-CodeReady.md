## Extra credit - use with CodeReady Workspaces
Let's use a web IDE called [CodeReady Workspaces][10] to change the app's code, build a new container, and deploy it.

* TBD - fork the app
* TBD - launch Che
* TBD - import your git repo
* TBD - change code
* TBD - build local (`mvn clean package`)
* TBD - deploy to cluster

:information_source: Another way that you might set this up in your environment is git commits trigger a pipeline execution
